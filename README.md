In this report we use github – Deep Learning with Differential Privacy to implement the differential privacy in deep learning.
At the beginning, we focus on the code on github to do research, find the place to set the parameters, and where the main functions are, then we change the parameters that will be used in the experiment, through the change of different parameters, we can observe the effect of the parameters on the Accuracy and the relationship between epcoh and epsilon.
